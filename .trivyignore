KSV001 # "A program inside the container can elevate its own privileges and run as root, which might give the program control over the container and node."

KSV003 # "The container should drop all default capabilities and add only those that are needed for its execution."

KSV012 # "Force the running image to run as a non-root user to ensure least privileges."

KSV013 # "It is best to avoid using the ':latest' image tag when deploying containers in production. Doing so makes it hard to track which version of the image is running, and hard to roll back the version."

KSV030 # "According to pod security standard 'Seccomp', the RuntimeDefault seccomp profile must be required, or allow specific additional profiles."

KSV104 # "A program inside the container can bypass Seccomp protection policies."

KSV105 # "Containers should be forbidden from running with a root UID."

KSV106 # "Containers must drop ALL capabilities, and are only permitted to add back the NET_BIND_SERVICE capability."
